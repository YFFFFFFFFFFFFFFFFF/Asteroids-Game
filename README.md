# Asteroids-Game
This is an Asteroids inspired game made in Codehs

It has been made with one AI prompt, which created the main game as a base to build upon for the final submission.

In order to build on what AI provided, I:
1. Added the ability to move the ship with the arrow keys
2. A login page with an arraylist to store user info, high scores

Some of the Key Features Include:

1. A collision detection system to increment/ decrement points/ lives
2. A login page with an arraylist to store user info

Instructions:

1. Enter a username and password then click register
2. If there is an error, try another username/ password combo, as the one you have entered already exists or is not a valid input
3. Click login, then make your selections in the game menu (GamePanel)
4. Play the game, shoot asteroid, ufos, and get powerups
5. Once the game is over, head back to the main menu to check you rank and score

The Goal:

To create an Asteroids style game using an AI prompt and then adding the ability to move the ship with 
the arrow keys, as well as a login page which registers and stores user info for later access and
rankings/ high scores. A selection of maps and ships with different characteristics were also planned. The login page, which I added
myself, needed to fit with the retro style of the game, thus necessitating appropriate fonts and colours to make it look like part of the game rather than a crude 
afterthought. I also intended to make the buttons and text boxes hexagonal to fix in with the space theme, but I was unable to achieve that aspect of my goal as they were JButtons rather than just shapes with mouse click detection as I'd worked with last year.
